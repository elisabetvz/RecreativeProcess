    <p class="details__content-text; div-block">

It will always be about creating meaning out of piecing the mundane together into a beautiful tapestry of uniqueness. 
It will always be about inspiring meaning. 
Whether it is telling stories, or creating branding for fashion brands, or communicating the vision of an artist, or making movies, or recording podcasts—the why will always be the power of stories, the significance of identity, the essence of meaning and interweaving the meaning translated through storytelling, through every passionate means, into society, to bring like-minded non-conformist futurist world changers together to create a future filled with hope, a hope that can only be found on the other side of knowing who we are. It starts with knowing who you are. It starts with knowing who you are through knowing your origins story. Where you came from, who imagined you, to burst forth a tangible reality from a seed of extraordinary imagination. ~ thoughts on my life mission, on why I do things, on what my work is focused on, and why. ~ EVZ, 07 JAN 2022. 

It’s beyond aesthetics or making great things. It has to have intention, it needs to mean something beyond what it is at a surface level. It needs to be transcendent. 

Being great or excellent or world’s best was never an option—it was assumed. I would never conform to nothing less than the highest standard. But we must not settle for the “how we do things”, that is simply a result of the culture we set, of our intentionality. The “what”, hence, the means can be anything that you’re passionate about and that drives you, that inspires you, that ignites a sense of wonder and beauty in your soul. But what matters most, what is unshakable, it is grounded in a deep conviction and worldview, is the WHY—why does it matter and why should we all care? 

It matters because it is the most powerful tool for connection, it matters because I cannot live through another day knowing that there are people struggling to find their identity, who have given up on meaning. It matters because the way you present and communicate someone’s brand, project, personality will have a huge impact in what that thing ends up becoming—if it will change lives or not, if it will bring people together or not, if it will build the future or not.

I WANT TO EMBRACE INNOVATION. 
I WANT TO JOIN FORCES WITH THOSE WHO ARE CREATING THE FUTURE TOO. 
I WANT TO PRESS ON TO FIND THE END OF THE STORY AND THE START OF A NEW ONE.

We’ve found meaning and identity in so many brands and trends. Stories we buy into to make up the reality we long for, to build a façade to hide our insecurities. Why don’t we create brands and stories and artist identities and businesses that bring meaning and hope to people, that point them to where they should find their identity by highlighting and emphasising the stories of heroes who have accomplished greatness and to pick their brains to find where they root their identity and what gives them meaning to do what they do.

I love hearing people’s stories. I love studying greatness. But what fascinates me the most is the intricate nit and gritty parts of the journey, the character development, the epiphanies at the low points, what drives them to wake up in the morning, what makes them who they are. Because it is out of who they are, out of who you are, that comes out what you create and produce. What you’re known for has your mark. You’re leaving fingerprints all over the world and they have your identity, your brand, your marker. What is your print creating? Impact or impression or is it just blending? 
Everything that you come in contact with can be an opportunity for you to leave your mark or to become something you’re not. Will you stand your ground for what you believe in or will you be tossed by the waves and fade away like sand? What kind of print do you want to leave? 

YOU ARE THE BRAND.
YOU ARE THE MARK.
YOU ARE THE MARKER.
IT STARTS WITH YOU. 

YOU CAN SHAPE HISTORY.
YOU CAN SHAPE FUTURES.
YOU CAN TRANSFER HOPE.
YOU CAN SPREAD LOVE.
YOU CAN IGNITE BOLDNESS.

It only takes an interaction. 
It only takes a relationship.
It only takes a conversation.
It only takes a production.
It only takes an invention.
It only takes a sentence.
It only takes a piece of your identity.

Everything is created out of what cannot be seen. You might not even see it, but your DNA can change the world, it starts with YOU. Who are you? 

~
We make sure there is no doubt about who you are.
We create the tangible reality of what your imagination breeds.
We explore the essence of your soul to depict its beauty to the world. 
~

The intentionality of design creates innovation when its intersected with film, and other creative domains, not just because of how it can elevate the work ethic and creative process—but because it points us to the why. 
Intentionality is about WHY. We don’t just do things because we love them—and we do—we don’t just do things excellently—and we do—but we most certainly work at that intersection of creativity because we believe in thinking outside of the norm, because we want to transmit that we are outsiders and we must embrace our unique identity and vision of the world. We want to represent those identities, we want to inspire others around the world that might have felt that way, we want to rise up a culture that is unstoppable by its boldness and known by its urgency to know who they are and who are intentional to find hope, to wrestle with their identity, to find meaning everyday in the mundane and create beauty out of the resources life has given them. In essence, to live extraordinary lives beyond the limits of what is seen or conceived. 
We want to elevate the conversation. Creativity is about us, it’s about who we are, and why we are. And that is what makes the greatest stories, the greatest work.

We are a Creative Studio with a vision and mission to bring out the extraordinary out of each identity, to change the world with the greatest version of you, your company, your project, or anything you give us. 

Because, you wouldn’t care about the ending if you didn’t know why the characters behaved that way. If you didn’t know Robin Hood’s pain and belief, then his story would be irrelevant. Meaning births stories, and conflict is the thread that connects them together.
